### Available Endpoints

-   `GET /api/products` — Returns a full list of all products.
-   `GET /api/products/:id` — Returns a single product by its ID.
-   `GET /api/products/categories` — Returns an array of available product category strings.
-   `GET /api/products/colors` — Returns an array of available color hex strings.
-   `GET /api/products/relevant` — Returns a list of products marked as "relevant" for the main page.

## 🧭 Routing


Routing is handled via **React Router v6**, utilizing the modern data router features (e.g., `createBrowserRouter`). 
All routes are defined centrally in `/src/app/app.tsx`.

A key feature of the routing setup is the dynamic generation of breadcrumbs. 
This is achieved by adding a `handle` object to each route definition. The `Breadcrumbs` component then uses the 
`useMatches()` hook to read these handles and render the navigation path.
